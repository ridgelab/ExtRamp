##########################

ExtRamp is a tool to extract the Ramp sequence from the beginning of genes.
It uses the tAI values (user provided) or codon proportions to determine the speed of translation
and the appropriate cut off point for the Ramp sequence.

##########################

ARGUMENT OPTIONS:

ExtRamp requires 2 user inputs at the command line:
	-i input	INPUT gzipped fasta file containing the cds gene sequences of interest
	
	
Optional arguments:
	-a tAI		(RECOMMENDED) INPUT file in csv format, contains the tAI values. Two formats are accepted as
					shown in the two included examples (S.cerevisiae_tAI_Values and Ecoli_tAI_Values)
	-o ramp		OUTPUT fasta file to write the ramp sequences to
	-v vals		OUTPUT file in csv format, the sequence speed values are written here if provided
	-t threads	The number of threads used to run the program, default is 10
	-w window	The number of codons in the ribosome window, default is 10 codons
	-n noRamp   OUTPUT Text file to write the gene names that contained no ramp sequence.
	-d stdev    The number of standard deviations below the mean the cutoff value will be. Deafult is 2.
	-m middle   The type of statistic used to measure the middle (consensus) efficiency. Options are 'mean', 'gmean', and 'median'. Default is 'gmean' 
	-r rna      A flag for RNA sequences. Default is DNA.

REQUIREMENTS:

ExtRamp.py uses Python version 3.5 in a Linux environment

Python Libraries:
1.  statistics
2.  gzip
3.  csv
4.  argparse
5.  sys
6.  tqdm (optional)
7.  multiprocessing
8.  numpy
9.  scipy
10. math
11. re


If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip3 install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.

USAGE

With tAI file (RECOMMENDED):

If you do not have the tAI values, check the stAicalc at:
http://tau-tai.azurewebsites.net/
A large list of the species with known tAI values is present. You must select a valid fasta
file and then click submit for the tAI values to be printed at the bottom. The fasta file 
does not need to be from the correct species, but it won't print the values until a file 
is selected. The values can then be exported into a CSV File.
 
python ExtRamp.py -i path/to/SEQUENCES.fasta.gz -a path/to/tAI.csv -o path/to/OUTFILE.fasta 

Without tAI file:

python ExtRamp.py -i path/to/SEQUENCES.fasta.gz -o path/to/OUTFILE.fasta

After running the top command, these updates will be printed to standard error:
Reading Sequences...
Calculating Codon Speeds...
Calculating Sequence Speeds...

Consensus Codon Efficiency using gmean: [NUMBER]
Standard Deviation: [NUMBER]
Maximum Efficiency in Ramp Sequence [NUMBER]

Isolating Ramp Sequences...

[NUMBER] Ramp Sequences found out of [NUMBER] total sequences

EXAMPLE USAGE

Try running ExtRamp.py on the provided S_cerevisiae example files in the example_files folder.

python ExtRamp.py -i example_files/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.gz -a example_files/S_cerevisiae_tAI_Values.csv -o outTest.fasta 

The output should match the S_cerevisiae_output.fast file in the example_files folder.
